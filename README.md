# Master-Mind-Solver-2.0
Master Mind solver for the standard version with 6 colors and 4 placements. The solver plays optimal by always finding the move that on average decreases the solution space the most.<br/>
**Note for player:** For optimal<sup>*</sup> play start the game with any move following a XXYY partern in colors. It has been proved to be superior to both XXYZ amd XYZW. <br/>
**Controls:**<br/>
Arrows keys - Moving around the grid<br/>
Enter - Running the solver (Like the “Run” button, it only works when a valid input has been made.)<br/>
Numbers 0-6 - Used for inputting the different colors and clues. (If there is no black or white feedback, zero must be entered in the respective column)<br/>
Backspace - For removing filled placeholders.

***Note:** I assume it to be optimal, but i am more than happy to be corrected.
